## Project Details

The backend is built with **FastAPI**, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.  
The frontend is a modern single-page application (SPA) built using **React**.  

The application manages a list of sweets, allowing users to view, search, purchase, and (for administrators) manage inventory.

## Key Features ✨

- **RESTful Backend API:** Built with FastAPI, handling all data logic.  
- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in, with secure token-based authentication (JWT) for protected endpoints.  
- **Sweets Management:** API endpoints for adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting sweets.  
- **Inventory Management:** Functionality to purchase sweets (decreasing quantity) and restock them (increasing quantity).  
- **Modern Frontend:** An interactive React SPA for a great user experience.  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** The project was developed with a focus on writing tests before implementation to ensure high test coverage and a robust application.

## My AI Usage 🤖

This project was built with assistance from AI tools, which are an integral part of my modern development workflow.

### AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**

### How I Used Them
- **Backend Development:** Used ChatGPT to generate some unit tests and initial boilerplate code for API endpoints, allowing me to focus more on core business logic and validation rules.  
- **Frontend Development:** Used ChatGPT to create the frontend application using React, React Router v7, and shadcn UI. This included generating component structures and initial layouts.  

### Reflection
AI significantly accelerated my development process by automating repetitive and boilerplate tasks. However, I ensured that the code was not simply copied, but used as a starting point that I augmented with my own logic, validation, and design choices to maintain a unique, high-quality result.
